The steady states are influenced by the design of the controller and turbine in the simulation. These states are useful for initializing the simulation, as they provide essential information for analyzing the turbine's power behavior and the controller settings. Additionally, these steady states play a crucial role in the overall wind turbine design and can be utilized to initialize further simulations.
