In addition to the challenge described in the previous section \ref{RatedWindSpeed} we discovered another one during the first iteration of the Steady States calculation. The rated conditions where met before we get into the Control Region 2.5. The cause of this was the rated generator speed of $\Omega_{G,\text{rated}} = \SI{458}{rpm}$ was set too high with the aerodynamic efficiency at this time. After we discovered this issue and addressed it with the electrical drive train team, they provided us a new design value (see Steady States \ref{steady states}), by increasing the number off poles in the generator. These value changes of rated wind speed \ref{RatedWindSpeed} and the generator speed resulted in a first draft of the Steady States of the Shakti WT as described in \ref{steady states}.\\
The issue isn't fully resolved here because we triggered an infinite design loop here. Hence the mechanical drive train team is not calculating the gearbox ratio $r_{\text{GB}}$ with the $\lambda_{\text{opt}} = 8.75$ but with another design value proposed by the management: The tip speed at $\lambda_{\text{opt}}$. Which is defined as $v_{\text{Tip}} = \SI{80}{m/s}$. So after the changes of the generator speed $\Omega_{G,\text{rated}}$ a new gearbox ratio $r_{\text{GB}}$ was calculated this would lead to the same issue described in the paragraph above. After clarification with the management we were able to resolve this issue because the tip speed was a maximal value $v_{\text{Tip}} = \hat{v}_{\text{Tip}}$, which we were not allowed to overstep but not a hard design value. The resulting solution is to keep the original gearbox ratio and adjust the Generator speed as described above.
