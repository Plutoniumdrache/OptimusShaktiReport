In conclusion all challenges encountered during the development of the Optimus Shakti 5.0 wind turbine were properly resolved.
Some key aspects that were learned from solving the described challenges in the section before are the following ones:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Model validation} is crucial before releasing the model/information to other participants of the project or working with a given model.
	\item \textbf{Plausibility check} of provided values and results either by comparing with previous or researching similar ones.
	\item Using \textbf{small steps} to apply changes in order to be able to keep an overview what changed in case unexpected behavior occurs.
	\item \textbf{Making the problem smaller} such as deactivating parts of a simulation model  that are not necessary in order to isolate the fault. (e.g. the controller or multiple \gls{DOF}) 
\end{itemize}
