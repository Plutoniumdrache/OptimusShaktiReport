% Tower equivalent bending stiffness calculation
%=================================================================================
For the implementation of the tower damper in the SLOW model the tower equivalent bending stiffness $k_\textnormal{Te}$ and the initial tower top deflection $X_\textnormal{T0}$ is needed. 
With OpenFAST the steady states calculations (section \ref{steady states}) with a wind speed range from \SI{3}{m/s} to \SI{9}{m/s} are done.
The bending stiffness of the tower can be calculated with: 
\begin{equation}
	k_{\textnormal{Te}} = \frac{F_\textnormal{a}}{X_\textnormal{T} - X_{\textnormal{T0}}}
	\label{equ:tower bending stiffness}
\end{equation}
Where $F_\textnormal{a}$ is the aerodynamic thrust force onto the rotor plane and $X_\textnormal{T}$ the deflection of the tower top.
The initial tower top deflection $X_\textnormal{T0}$ is determined from the calculated steady states via a polyfit of the curve to get the deflection of the tower at $F_\textnormal{a} = \SI{0}{N}$.
With \ref{equ:tower bending stiffness} the bending stiffness in every steady state is determined and averaged over the number of points. 
This leads to an tower equivalent bending stiffness of $k_\textnormal{Te} = \SI{2.185}{\mega \newton /\meter}$ and a initial tower top deflection of $X_\textnormal{T0} = \SI{-0.021}{m}$.
