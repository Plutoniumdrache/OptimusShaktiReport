% Tower Damper
%=================================================================================
This section describes the function and the implementation of a pitch angle based \gls{td}. 
The design follows the description in \cite{WindEnergyHandbook} similar as the workflow in the exercise of the corresponding lecture \cite{SchlipfLecture}. 
The tower dynamics are modeled as in \cite{WindEnergyHandbook} (eq: 8.12 and 8.13). 
Here referred to as \ref{eq:TowerDynamics} and \ref{eq:TowerDamper}.
\begin{equation}
	M\ddot{x} + D\dot{x} + Kx = F + \Delta F
	\label{eq:TowerDynamics}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\Delta F = \frac{\partial F}{\partial \theta}\Delta\theta = -D_{\text{TD}}\dot{x}\\
		\Delta\theta = \frac{-D_{\text{TD}}}{\partial F/\partial \theta}\dot{x}
	\end{aligned}
	\label{eq:TowerDamper}
\end{equation}
As described by \ref{eq:TowerDynamics} the dynamics of the tower in fore-aft direction are lightly damped if $D$ is small and the force $\Delta F$ which is the additional thrust force resulting of a pitch action is equal to zero. The force $F$ is damped by the relative wind speed $v_{\text{rel}} = v_0 - \dot{x}$ and therefore $F = F(\Omega, \theta, v_{\text{rel}})$ \cite{SchlipfLecture}. To damp the tower top speed $\dot{x}$ even further \cite{WindEnergyHandbook} proposes an update of the pitch angle with $\Delta\theta$. This will damp the tower motion further as described in \ref{eq:TowerDamper}. This leads to a reduction of the tower bottom bending moment. Nevertheless this comes at a cost of higher pitch activity and the damping is only available in control region 3. 
%The static tower top deflection over the regions are shown in section \ref{steady states}. This is helpful to see when the damper is active and what can be damped.

The implementation and test of the damper is done in Matlab and Simulink.
As in the lecture \cite{SchlipfLecture} and corresponding exercise the tower top acceleration $\ddot{x}$ is used because it a quantity that is measurable in reality as well.
What is also taken into account is the existence of a real pitch actuator. This means that the pitch update $\Delta\theta$ can not be applied instantaneously because of the time constant of the pitch actuator.
To address this phenomena there are 2 methods tested. 
First a direct integration \ref{eq:TDintegration}: 
\begin{equation}
	\dot{x}(t) = \int\ddot{x}(t) \text{d}t
	\label{eq:TDintegration}
\end{equation} 
And second a phase shift of \SI{90}{\degree} of the acceleration signal by a Lag-Compensator. The transfer function in the frequency domain is shown in \ref{eq:LagCompensator}. Where the input in the frequency domain is $\ddot{X}(s)$ and the output is $\dot{X}(s)$. 
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\ddot{X}(s)}{\dot{X}(s)} = \frac{s + z}{s + p}
	\label{eq:LagCompensator}
\end{equation} 
\begin{equation}
	\dot{x}(t) = \ddot{x}(t) - \int p\dot{x}(t) - z\ddot{x}(t) \text{d}t
	\label{eq:xddTimeDomain}
\end{equation} 

% explain analytical why this should work better?

The implementation in Simulink (Figure \ref{fig:TDoverview}) is first following the approach in the exercise \cite{SchlipfLecture}.

\begin{figure}[tbh]

\end{figure} 

The input \textit{Omega\_g} is already a low pass filtered quantity and the blade passing frequency (3P) is notched out. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:TDoverview} to activate the \gls{td} the generator power is used. The \textit{LowPassOrder1} is used to reduce the switching frequency of the TD to ensure that it is not switched on and off if the \gls{WT} is operating near rated conditions. In the activation the gain is slowly ramped up from $\SI{0}{\%}$ to $\SI{100}{\%}$ over a power range from $\SI{80}{\%}$ of the rated power to $\SI{100}{\%}$.
For higher power values the gain stays at \SI{100}{\%}.

In the first method, here named integrator, the tower top acceleration signal is integrated.
The signal is than multiplied with the damping gain \textit{Parameter.TD.gain} and the activation signal as shown in Figure \ref{fig:TDoverview}.
The resulting quantity is the pitch offset mentioned in equation \ref{eq:TowerDamper}.
This offset $\Delta\theta$ is added to the pitch angle control value of the \gls{cpc} and this sum is the new input for the pitch actuator in the SLOW-model.

\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics[width=12cm]{Figures/BodeLagCompensator.eps}
	\caption{Bode plot of the Lag-Compensator}
	\label{fig:BodeLag}
\end{figure}

The second method, here named Lag-Compensator, isolates the tower eigenfrequency by passing the acceleration signal first through a low pass filter and than a high pass filter. The cutoff frequency of the low pass filter is above the eigenfrequency of the tower and the cutoff frequency of the high pass filter is below the eigenfrequency. Now the signal contains mainly the isolated eigenfrequency of the tower with which the tower is oscillating in the fore-aft direction. To phase shift the signal a Lag-Compensator is used.


As shown in Figure \ref{fig:BodeLag} the frequency is phase shifted by nearly \SI{90}{\degree} and the magnitude is increasing by $\SI{30}{dB}$. The increase in magnitude and the general difference in magnitude of the $\ddot{x}(t)$ signal compared to the $\dot{x}(t)$ can be solved by adjusting the gain value. The adjusted gain value will result in similar damping behavior.

Figure \ref{fig:ZeroPoleLag} shows the Pole-Zero-Map of the Lag-Compensator. The $\color{blue} \circ$ shows the zero and the $\color{blue} \times$ shows the pole. The values of zero $z = -100$ and the pole $p = -0.125$ showing a stable behavior because they have negative real component.

\end{figure} 

The design is tested first with a wind step from $v_0 = \SI{20}{m/s}$ to $v_1 = \SI{21}{m/s}$. The results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:TDWindStep}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering	
	\includegraphics[width=12cm]{Figures/WindStep.eps}
	\caption{Tower-Top-Speed}
	\label{fig:TDWindStep}
\end{figure}
 
The comparison of the two used damping methods shows that the Lag-Compensator is damping more aggressive at the beginning of the oscillation. The end of oscillation is faster realized by the Integrator.   

To further test the used methods the SLOW-Model is disturbed with a turbulent wind field similar to the exercise in \cite{SchlipfLecture}. The reduction in DEL for the tower base bending moment is evaluated by the tower base bending moment spectrum computed in figure \ref{fig:TDDEL}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering	
	\includegraphics[width=12cm]{Figures/TDSpectrum.eps}
	\caption{Spectrum of the tower base bending moment}
	\label{fig:TDDEL}
\end{figure}
  
Both methods reducing the loads at the eigenfrequency of the tower. The comparison of the damping method shows, that the Lag-Compensator has a higher damping effect at the eigenfrequency but leads to higher loads between $\SI{0.1}{Hz}$ and $\SI{0.2}{Hz}$ as well as above the eigenfrequency between $\SI{0.35}{Hz}$ and $\SI{0.55}{Hz}$. The Lag-Compensator can be tuned in such a way that the damping at the eigenfrequency is similar to the integrator method which will reduce the loads in the above mentioned frequency ranges.

One remaining task here is the tuning of the Lag-Compensator to compare it again against the integrator. 

The second task is to re-tune the \gls{td} for the \gls{shakti} tower. 
This is not done yet due to the unfinished tower design.
