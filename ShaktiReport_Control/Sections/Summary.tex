\chapter{Summary (Felix)}
This chapter contains the overall process of the \gls{shakti} design project.
Improvements and possible future work is also contained.
\section{Conclusion}
The implementation and tuning of the \gls{WT} controller is important for the overall performance of a \gls{WT}. 
Hence it effects efficiency and lifespan of the whole \gls{WT}.

The used controller is an advanced torque controller and \gls{cpc} controller. 

The controller tuning involves the optimization for the different control regions. 

This is realized via Brute-Force-Optimization of the static and dynamic control parameters.   





During the project the control team was facing not only tasks regarding the tuning of the controller but also many interface issues during the design process of the \gls{shakti}.
As described in Chapter \ref{Challenges}. 
These took more time than expected but is still part of the learning.

    

\section{Improvements and Future Workflow}
This section begins with the possible improvements regarding the general workflow of the \gls{shakti} project and the controller design.
Due to the short time span of the project, main components like the tower or the structural design of the blades are finished late in the project.
