\chapter{Controller Design Objectives} \label{chapter: controller design obj}
%=================================================================================
The motivation of control in \gls{WT} is to optimize the energy production, avoid overspeed or other constraints and reduce structural loads \cite{SchlipfLecture}.
In order to manage the above named requirements there are different control tools used.
They are organized in an hierarchical order \cite{WindEnergyHandbook}:
\begin{enumerate} 
	\item safety system
	\item supervisory control
	\item \gls{CLC}
\end{enumerate} 
During the project of the \gls{shakti} turbine the focus was on the development of the \gls{CLC}.
%=================================================================================
\section{Closed-Loop Control (Soni)} \label{Advanced controller}
Figure \ref{fig:Closed-loop Wind Turbine Control} illustrates the \gls{CLC} system of a wind turbine.
The main control subject is the rotational speed of the turbine.
To obtain the desired behavior two different controllers are used, the pitch controller and the torque controller.

\end{figure}

The torque controller optimizes power production below rated wind speed and maintain rated power above rated wind speed by adjusting generator torque (\gls{symb:M_G}) based on generator speed (\gls{symb:Omega_G}).
The torque controller uses a PI-controller with anti-windup to regulate the generator torque based on the difference between the actual and reference generator speed.
\\
\\
Above rated wind speed, the pitch controller maintains the rated generator speed (\gls{symb:Omega_G_rated}) by adjusting the blade pitch angle (\gls{symb:theta}), which ensures the rated power is maintained.
With increasing wind speed, the pitch angle increases to reduce the power coefficient (\gls{symb:cp}).
Once the wind speed reaches the rated value, the generator torque is maintained at its rated value.
The control is categorized into different regions, as detailed in section \ref{control regions}.
%=================================================================================
\section{Control Regions (Soni)} \label{control regions}

Wind turbine operations are segmented into three primary and two transition regions based on varying wind speed. These regions are explained in detail below and illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:control regions}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figures/Figure_2.jpg}
	\caption{Wind turbine control regions \cite{SchlipfLecture}}
	\label{fig:control regions} 
\end{figure}

\textbf{Control Region 1:} The wind speed is below the cut-in wind speed (\gls{symb:v_in}). 
The turbine does not generate any power.
There is no pitch activity.
\\
\\
\textbf{Control Region 1.5:} This is a transition to Region 2.
The wind speed is sufficient to accelerate rotor and increase the generator torque.
The goal is to quickly reach Region 2.
There is no pitch activity.
\\
\\
\textbf{Control Region 2:} Wind speeds are above the cut-in speed (\gls{symb:v_in}) but below the rated wind speed (\gls{symb:v_rated}). 
The primary objective is to maximize energy yield.
To achieve this, the power coefficient (\gls{symb:cp_opt}) is kept at its optimum. 
There is no pitch activity.
The control system ensures that the turbine maintains these optimal conditions by regulating the rotational speed through the torque controller.
In this region, the generator torque is adjusted based on rotor speed, as shown in Equation \ref{equation:MG}.

\begin{equation}
	M_{\textnormal{G}} = \frac{1}{2} \rho R^5 \frac{C_{p,\textnormal{opt}}}{{\lambda_{\textnormal{opt}}^3 \gls{symb:rGB}^3}} \Omega_{\textnormal{G}}^2
	\label{equation:MG}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	M_{\textnormal{G}} = k\Omega_{\textnormal{G}}^2
	\label{equation:MG_2}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Control Region 2.5:} This is a transition to Region 3.
The rotational speed and the torque are raised until they reach the rated values. 
The goal is to quickly and smoothly reach Region 3.
There is no pitch activity.

\textbf{Control Region 3:} 
In this region, wind speeds have reached the rated wind speed.
The control goal is to maintain rated power and generator speed as well as reduce structural loads.
The pitch controller actively adjusts the blade pitch angle to regulate the speed and keep the power within the turbines rated conditions.
%=================================================================================
\section{Advanced Generator Torque Controller (Soni)} \label{Torque controller}
Generator torque is one of the two main control inputs for a wind turbine.
The performance of an advanced generator torque controller offers significant improvements and greater flexibility compared to a baseline torque controller.
The primary goal of the advanced torque controller is to reach the optimal power curve earlier and to maintain it for a longer duration compared to the baseline controller.
Additionally, the dynamics in Regions 1.5 and 2.5 are tunable, allowing for more precise control.
\\
\\
Goals of the advanced torque controller:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Achieve the optimal power curve earlier and maintain it for a longer period.
	\item Enable tunable dynamics in Regions 1.5 and 2.5.
	\item Interaction with PI-pitch controller to reduce loads and increase energy yield.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Figure_3.jpg}
	\caption{Wind turbine control regions \cite{SchlipfLecture}} 
	\label{WT control region}
\end{figure}

Strategy for the Advanced Torque Controller:

\textbf{Region 1.5:} Lowest generator speed $\Omega_{\textnormal{G,1.5}}$ set to avoid the 3P frequency interacting with the tower's eigenfrequency.

\textbf{Region 2:} The controller aims to maximize energy yield while ensuring the turbine operates efficiently.

\textbf{Region 2.5:} Generator speed $\Omega_\textnormal{G,2.5} = \gls{symb:Omega_G_rated}$.
Switch from $\Omega_{\textnormal{G,1.5}}$ to $\Omega_{\textnormal{G,2.5}}$ if the measured generator speed \gls{symb:Omega_G} exceeds 

\begin{equation}
	\Omega_{\textnormal{G,R2switch}} = \frac{1}{2} (\Omega_{\textnormal{G,1.5}} + \Omega_{\textnormal{G,2.5}})
	\label{equation:Omega_Region_2.5}
\end{equation}

Torque Limits: 

The generator torque limits are determined by the measured generator speed \gls{symb:Omega_G} and incorporate Anti-Windup mechanisms.

\begin{itemize}
	
	\item if \gls{symb:Omega_G} < $\Omega_{\textnormal{G,R2switch}}$:
	
	\begin{equation}
		M_{\textnormal{G,lb}} = 0
		\label{equation:MG,lb}
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
		M_{\textnormal{G,ub}} = k \Omega_{\textnormal{G}}^2
		\label{equation:MG,ub}
	\end{equation}
	
	\item if\gls{symb:Omega_G} > $\Omega_{\textnormal{G,R2switch}}$:
	
	\begin{equation}
		M_{\textnormal{G,lb}} = k \Omega_{\textnormal{G}}^2
		\label{equation:MG,lb,2}
	\end{equation}
	
	\begin{equation} 
		M_{\textnormal{G,ub}} = \min\left(M_{\textnormal{G,{rated}}}\frac{\Omega_{\textnormal{G,{rated}}}}{\Omega_{\textnormal{G}}}, M_{\textnormal{G,max}}\right)
		\label{equation:MG,ub,2}
	\end{equation}
	
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Region 3:} Adjusted limits for the generator torque based on the generator speed.

The design parameters for the PI controller are derived similar to exercise 3 of \cite{SchlipfLecture}.
